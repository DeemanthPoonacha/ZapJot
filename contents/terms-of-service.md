**Effective Date:** 2025-05-20

Welcome to **ZapJot**, your personal digital journal and planning companion. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our mobile and web applications ("App"), services, and website (collectively, the "Services").

By creating an account or using ZapJot, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Using ZapJot

You must be at least 13 years old to use ZapJot. By using our Services, you affirm that:

- All information you provide is accurate.
- You’re solely responsible for your content.
- You will use the app lawfully and respectfully.

## 2. Your Content

ZapJot allows you to create and manage personal content such as journals, planners, characters, goals, and reminders.

- **Ownership:** You retain full ownership of your content.
- **Private by Default:** Content is private unless explicitly shared.
- **Encrypted Journals:** Your journal content is encrypted on your device using client-side AES encryption. Only you can decrypt and access it.

## 3. Account Security

You are responsible for keeping your Firebase Authentication credentials (email, password, or other sign-in methods) secure.

- Your journal encryption key is encrypted and stored in Firestore using your authentication data, allowing recovery if you log in.
- However, if you lose access to your authentication credentials (for example, you lose access to your email or cannot sign in), you may lose access to your encrypted journal content.
- We do not have access to your unencrypted encryption key or your journal content and cannot recover your data if your authentication credentials are lost.

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the app for illegal or abusive activities.
- Attempt to reverse-engineer or tamper with the app.
- Upload harmful or malicious content.

## 5. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services if you violate these Terms or use ZapJot in a harmful or abusive manner.

## 6. Modifications

We may update these Terms occasionally. We’ll notify you of significant changes. Continuing to use the app after changes are posted means you accept the revised Terms.

## 7. Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability

ZapJot is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any damages arising from use of the app, including loss of data due to forgotten credentials or misuse of encrypted content.
