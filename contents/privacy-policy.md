# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2025-05-20

We at **ZapJot** value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Services.

---

## 1. Data We Collect

We collect only the data necessary to provide a secure and seamless experience:

- **Account Information:** Your email address, name, and authentication data via Firebase Authentication.
- **User Content:** Journals, planners, tasks, characters, goals, and other information you create.
- **Metadata:** Timestamps, chapter titles, tags, and other non-sensitive metadata used for search and filtering.
- **App Usage Data (Anonymous):** Crash logs, app performance data, and basic usage statistics to improve the service. No personally identifiable information is included.

---

## 2. Client-Side Encryption

Your privacy is our priority. We use **end-to-end AES encryption** for all journal content:

- Only **you** can decrypt your encrypted journal entries. Not even ZapJot has access to your private content.
- Metadata (e.g., chapter titles, creation dates) may be stored in plaintext to support functionality like filtering and search.
- Your encryption key is stored securely on your device and in Firestore, where it is encrypted using a key derived from your Firebase Auth credentials.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Data

We use your information strictly to:

- Provide and improve the core features of ZapJot.
- Deliver essential functionality, such as reminders, notifications, and secure backups.
- Diagnose errors, fix bugs, and support your experience.

We **do not sell, trade, or share your personal data** with advertisers or any third parties.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

ZapJot uses reputable and secure services, including:

- **Firebase Authentication** – for login and secure session handling.
- **Firestore** – for storing your data safely.
- **Firebase Crashlytics** (optional/anonymous) – to diagnose crashes and app issues.

These providers have their own privacy practices. We recommend reviewing [Firebase’s Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy) for more information.

---

## 5. Your Rights

You have full control over your data:

- View or edit your content anytime from the app.
- Export your journal and planner data in a readable format.
- Permanently delete your account and all associated data upon request.

To initiate data export or deletion, contact support or use in-app settings (if available).

---

## 6. Data Retention

- Your data is retained only while your account is active.
- When you delete your account, all your data — including encrypted journals — is permanently removed from our servers.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

ZapJot is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children without verified parental consent. If we become aware of such data, we will delete it promptly.

---

## 8. Security Measures

We implement strong security protocols including:

- **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive content
- **Secure authentication** via Firebase
- **HTTPS** for all data transmission

However, no system is completely foolproof. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure.

## 9. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the "Effective Date" above. Significant changes may be communicated to users directly.
